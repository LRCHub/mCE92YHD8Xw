I'm re-submitting the lyrics for "looks aren't everything" as i may have turned a few words around. these will be correct, Will

Looks like she's found another lover, judging by the way she looks tonight.

He's got her wrapped around his fingers, she's falling right into his eyes.

But looks aren't everything, take it from a man who knows
Looks aren't everything, what's in her heart doesn't always show
I know how she looks, but looks aren't everything.

See the way she smiles when he holds her,
Looks as if she's in his arms to stay
To think she once cried on my shoulder,
And smiled at me that same old way
